##  Background
- The objective of the Email Spam Classifier and SMS Spam Classifier projects is to develop machine learning models and algorithms that can automatically categorize incoming emails and texts as spam (unwanted, unsolicited) or legitimate (non-spam) depending on their content and features. The main objective is to build a platform that filters out undesirable messages, which will enhance email and messaging for users.
## 
- User Experience: Unwanted spam emails and SMS messages may annoy users and take up valuable time by clogging up inboxes. This project attempts to improve the user experience by effectively detecting and filtering out spam and ensuring that critical messages are not lost among irrelevant ones.
- Security and privacy: Spam emails can include unsafe content, phishing attempts, or fraudulent schemes. This project may contribute to increased security and safeguard consumers from potential dangers and scams by properly recognizing and blocking spam.
- Resource Efficiency: Spam messages consumeÂ computing, storage, and network resources. Particularly with large email and messaging systems, lowering the amount of spam can result in more effective resource management.
## 
- Which machine learning algorithms and techniques are most effective for spam classification in emails and SMS messages?
- What features or attributes of emails and SMS messages are most indicative of spam content?
- Are there any common patterns or keywords that distinguish spam messages from non-spam messages?

##  Data Description
- Data Sources: The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is related to the SMS Spam Collection Dataset Collection of SMS messages tagged as spam or legitimate.
- Data Set Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?resource=download
- Data Size: The dataset is relatively small, with a size of approximately 503 KB.
- Data Description: The "spam.csv" dataset contains information related to SMS messages or emails, particularly focusing on spam classification. It is designed for machine learning tasks to predict whether a message is spam or not based on various features and attributes.
- Data Fields:
    v1 (Label): A binary classification label indicating whether a message is spam or not. Typically, it takes values like "ham" (for non-spam) and "spam" (for spam).
    v2 (Text): The text content of the SMS message or email.
- Dataset Size:
    Number of Rows (Samples): 5572
    Number of Columns (Features): 2
- Data Types:
    v1 (Label): Categorical (binary)
    v2 (Text): Text data
